pvPortMalloc() is called internally by the kernel whenever a task, queue,
timer or semaphore is created. It is also called by various parts of the
demo application. If heap_1.c or heap_2.c are used, then the size of the
heap available to pvPortMalloc() is defined by configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE in
FreeRTOSConfig.h, and the xPortGetFreeHeapSize() API function can be used
to query the size of free heap space that remains (although it does not
provide information on how the remaining heap might be fragmented). */
